INSTALLING

1) Run the configure script to check for dependencies:

	$ ./configure

2) Build btcwatch with make. You can either build a standard or debug build:

	$ make

	OR

	$ make debug

3) Depending on your preference, you may install btcwatch (as root) normally, or as a stripped binary (although the latter will only strip the normal build, for obvious reasons):

	# make install

	OR

	# make install-strip

USING BTCWATCH

Using btcwatch is incredibly straightforward. To get buy and sell prices, simply run btcwatch with no arguments:

	$ btcwatch
	result: success
	buy: 132.850769 USD
	sell: 133.990005 USD

btcwatch will automatically print verbose output (-v) when no arguments are provided, with the currency string at the end of the value, and a identifier before.
To only request one item, run btcwatch with one of -p (checks for a successful JSON string from MtGox), -b (buy price), or -s (sell price). The order you specify those options does indeed matter, as that is the order that they will be processed and printed to the screen, for example:

	$ btcwatch -v -b
	buy: 133.750000 USD

	$ btcwatch -v -sb
	sell: 133.979996 USD
	buy: 133.750000 USD

	$ btcwatch -v -sbp
	sell: 133.979996 USD
	buy: 133.750000 USD
	result: success

Removing the -v (verbose) option will remove the currency string and the identifiers from output:

	$ btcwatch -sbp
	133.979996
	133.750000
	success

To change the currency from USD to something else, use the -c (currency) option:

	$ btcwatch -vc GBP -b
	buy: 81.789719 GBP

	$ btcwatch -vc AUD -b
	buy: 139.830215 AUD

	$ btcwatch -vc EUR -b
	buy: 98.699997 EUR

The case you write the currency in doesn't matter:

	$ btcwatch -vc gbp -b
	buy: 81.807930 GBP

CLEANING

To remove all files generated by make, run:

	$ make clean

To remove the above and all files generated by ./configure, run:

	$ make distclean
