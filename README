btcwatch

ABOUT

btcwatch is a program that will allow its users to view the current exchange rate of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It is distributed with a library "btcapi" that gets a json string and parses it with jansson to get information which at the moment only consists of 'result', 'buy', and 'sell' (with more to be added later on). In the future it will be a lot better.
